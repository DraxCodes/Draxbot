Everything about the news post is editable and raids will change based on what the current expasion has.
#### Example Usage:
User :  ``!news raid main``

Bot  :  ``Enter Raid (EN, NH, TOS, Antorus) TOV Not Supported!``

User :  ``Antorus``

Bot  :  ``Enter Date of raid (Example: Monday 22nd Jan)``

Bot  :  ``Enter time of raid (Example 8pm ST)``

User :  ``8pm ST``

Bot  :  ``Enter any extra Details, put None if you don't need top add extra details!``

User :  If you have no description for the raid you put ``none`` Otherwise you simply type it here.

#### This example works for the other two commands as-well ``!news raid social`` & ``!news guild``
